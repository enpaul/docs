Ubiquiti's EdgeMax platform is the closest thing you can get to an enterprise
grade router for less than $200. I bought my EdgeRouter Lite (ERL) for my first
apartment almost five years ago and I have never once regretted my decision.
The only time I've ever thought about giving it up was when I briefly thought
about buying a bigger EdgeRouter.

The EdgeMax/EdgeRouter operating system, creatively named EdgeOS, is a fork of
the open source [VyOS](https://vyos.io/) and is loaded with excellent features
and a killer web UI.

The ERL is fanless and sports three gigabit ethernet ports, as well as a
dedicated serial console port for when I inevitably lock myself out.

It's also rackmountable:
